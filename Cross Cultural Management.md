Cross Cultural Management
========================

_Cross-Cultural Management Textbook_, a collective work, edited by Jérôme Dumetz

## Misunderstandings

In Spain, salted means funny. In South America, salted means jinxed. We must be careful with meaning since even the basic things have different meaning.

## Why is Cultural awareness important ?

Globalisation : speed, everything is faster than before

_The world is flat_, by Thomas Friedman => The world is more globalized than we think it is

Faster communication technologies, prevent us from having a buffer time to think about the answer

Movement of labour, goods and ideas on the rise

Because ethnocentrism is still dominant

## Why cooperating across cultures ?

1. Benevolence: recognise the strengths of every party and being nice
2. Clarity: clear instructions, avoid uncertainty
3. Reciprocity: after a certain period, a reciprocity must be felt, otherwise it does not feel fair
4. Creativity: multi-cultural cooperation stimulates creativity

## Cultural Competence & Cultural Intelligence (IQ)

A new skills measurement that takes into account three elements:

* The Know-What (Acquiring knowledge)
* The Know-How (Acquiring aptitudes in communicating)
* The Know-Being (Acquiring attitudes)

## Cultural studies

* New discipline
* Anthropology applied to Business
* Our "Gurus":
	* Hall, Levi Strauss, Mead
	* Samovar, Schein
	* Hofstede, Trompenaars, D'Iribane
	* Mole, Lewis

We must be careful to not come with preconceived opinions, since we can force these opinions on other.

## Origins and associated fields of cross-cultural communication

Ethology => Primatology

Analysis on primates social organization to understand cross-cultural communications, primarily on chimpanzee and bonobos

Comparing behaviors:

Conflict resoluton style : Power <-> Empathy

There are no Cultures, only behaviors

Human Nature -> Culture -> Personnality

Being open-minded is a requirement, every situation has a context

Culture-gap: how much two cultures are different

The changement is more complicated when we go to a neibourgh country

## Generalization

A statement about a _tendency_ of many people in a group to hold certain value

## What is Culture ?

Culture is about Non-Verbal Communications and Artefacts, it can be misunderstood. It is about food, reaction to the unexpected...

Culture is how we _prefer_ to solve _problem_ as a _group_

Culture is mostly about **behaviours**

Not predictive behaviours, but _expected_ behaviours

We disagree on the preferences to solve issues, not on the solutions, we share the same solutions.

### Culture differences...

* Between countries
* Between sectors
* Between companies
* Between companies' departments

### Elements of culture

* Rites, traditions
* Superstitions
* Fairy tales
* Meanings in various cultures
* Language format
* Colors
* Numbers
* Names / words
* Roles a group, family

### Core elements

* Similar to "Archetypes"
* Hard to analyze
* Influenced by
	* Geography
	* Climate
	* History
	* Traditions

## Paralingual communication

"Paralanguage" refers to _how_ we say

## Proxemics

Speaking distance, we associate a meaning based on the distance where we speak

Kinesthesia => touching across cultures

In Japan, the managers of Fukushima asked on their knees for forgiveness the people in shelter

## Cultural models

* Hall's High-Context and Low-Context Cultural Framework
* Hofstede, however not recommended since the data can be erronous and don't change over the years
* Trompenaars, take into account the minority behaviour, updated regurlaly
* The GLOBE Framework, useful information for the homework, the most trustful
* Steyr Intercultural Management Model

## Cultural dimensions

* Half-way across personality characteristics and sociological types
* Need to be understood through the relative position on one individual towards a group
* Help identify personal cultural gaps towards a given culture
* Locus of control (Inner-control / Outer-control)
* Universalism vs Particularism
* Individualism vs Collectivism
* Hierarchy & Power distance
* Specific and diffuse

## The economics of Trust

* when trust goes down, speed will also go down and costs will go up
* when trust goes up, speed will also go up and costs will go down

## Homework

For the end of the month, write, for 5 case studies, one page each

## Conclusion tips

* **Knowledge**
* **Open-mindedness**
* **Awareness & Respect**
